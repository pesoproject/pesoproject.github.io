## Google Notebook LM Explains the PESO Project!

_Google's [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google.com) provides great content summarization.  This podcast provides a fun and useful description of the PESO Project and the products that are a key focus of PESO: [E4S](https://e4s.io) and [Spack](https://spack.io).  Pronunciation of PESO is not perfect (pronounced PEE-SO instead of PAY-SO) but the content is still valuable and worth a listen if you want to understand the big picture of the PESO project and all it does._

We hope you enjoy it: [Google's NotebookLM explains the PESO Project in a podcast](https://pesoproject.org/files/2024-10-NotebookLMPESOProjectOverview)
