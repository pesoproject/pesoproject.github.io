## PESO Vision

PESO will establish and steward a scientific software ecosystem with stakeholders and partners who engage with the US Department of Energy (DOE) in developing and using advanced high-performance computing.

**PESO's vision is that DOE software investments will have maximum impact by providing a sustainable scientific software ecosystem, consisting of high-quality libraries and tools that deliver the latest high-performance algorithms and capabilities to serve application needs at DOE and beyond.**

*Partnering* with others, PESO will provide critical *services* and *products* that **transform a broad collection of independently developed products by independent teams into a product portfolio whose total is much more than the sum of its parts.** Furthermore, by working with product teams, users, stakeholders, computing facilities, other US agencies, and industry, we will provide a transition of activities from the DOE Exascale Computing Project (ECP) toward the goal of creating a software ecosystem that year over year will deliver high-quality, reliable, and trusted libraries and tools for DOE's mission-critical applications.

ECP efforts have demonstrated that developing applications built on accelerator-optimized libraries and tools can improve scientific capabilities by two orders of magnitude or more and that a trusted software stack is an essential element. **PESO will provide the trusted software stack for applications to realize that 100X improvement---for high-end capabilities _and_ for energy efficiency improvements that can be realized only by leveraging accelerator devices.**

PESO will execute all efforts within and as part of the Scientific Software Stewardship Consortium (S3C), a federation of Software Stewardship Organizations (SSOs) with distinct but complementary foci. PESO will emphasize software product quality, the continued fostering of software product communities, and the delivery of products via Spack and E4S---a trusted open-source scientific software stack that addresses DOE's high-performance computing mission.
PESO work will focus on three thrust areas:

- **Partnerships:** PESO will engage with other ecosystem members to ensure our efforts address the highest priority needs and provide effective and efficient solutions leveraged across multiple members. We will lead efforts in SCCC to foster a diverse and inclusive workforce with sustainable career paths and to promote inclusive and equitable research (PIER planning). We also will elevate the roles of software in DOE's computing sciences by shepherding the Better Scientific Software (BSSw) Fellows Program and contributing to the leadership of the BSSw.io web portal (in partnership with the COLABS SSO).
- **Services:** PESO will provide services needed by other ecosystem members, including software product management, software product integration, and software product delivery. We will also address software quality assurance and security, providing infrastructure to support and leverage efforts by product teams.
- **Products:** We will deliver and support Spack and E4S; we will provide porting and testing platforms to be leveraged across all product teams to ensure the stability of existing code and the portability of new code. We will also facilitate the delivery and support of other products, such as AI/ML libraries and tools that are needed by the HPC community.

PESO efforts will emphasize broad engagement with the HPC community to ensure that post-ECP efforts leverage the knowledge and infrastructure from ECP and also capture the contributions and needs of HPC community members who were not engaged in ECP.

**Impact of proposed work.**
In collaboration with other software stewardship organizations and as part of the SCCC consortium, PESO will grow and diversify the DOE workforce community, improve the quality of scientific software, and enable new and highly productive scientific software teams. Finally, PESO will deliver a trusted software stack that is ready for production use on DOE exascale systems and available to the broader HPC community to deliver the 100X improvement in scientific capabilities and energy efficiency that DOE seeks to achieve for the scientific computing community. Through its partnerships, services, and products, PESO will play a critical and unique role in establishing a trusted software ecosystem that is essential to DOE's mission.
