PESO’s vision is that DOE software investments will have maximum impact by:
</p>
<ul class="text-gray-600" style="list-style: circle; margin-left: 1em">
    <li><strong>Delivering a robust, evolving, and widely-available portfolio of scientific libraries and tools to the community:</strong> We provide a scientific software ecosystem via Spack and E4S, consisting of high-quality libraries and tools developed by the <a href="https://cass.community">CASS community</a> and other providers, deliver the latest high-performance algorithms and capabilities to applications at DOE and beyond. Partnering with others, PESO will provide critical services and products that transform a broad collection of independently developed products by independent teams into a product portfolio whose total is much more than the sum of its parts.</li>
<li><strong>Improving the quality of the work we do by focusing on user and developer experience for improved impact of our libraries and tools on the scientific community:</strong> We invest in scientific approaches improving user and developer experiences, including a better understanding and improvement of software product management, integration, and delivery, software quality assurance, and security.</li>
<li><strong>Focusing on community engagement as a first-order priority:</strong> We will collaborate in CASS efforts to foster an inclusive workforce with sustainable career paths. We will shepherd the Better Scientific Software Fellows Program and contribute to the leadership of the <a href="https://bssw.io">BSSw.io web portal</a>.</li>
</ul>
