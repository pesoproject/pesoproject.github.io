# 2024 CASS Community BOF Days
## June 11-13, 2024

We are pleased to announce the **2024 CASS Community Birds-of-a-Feather (BOF) Days**, led by the newly established _Consortium for the Advancement of Scientific Software (CASS)_ and hosted by the PESO (Partnering for Scientific Software Ecosystem Stewardship) project.  This event builds on the tradition of ECP Community BOF Days, which were hosted by the DOE Exascale Computing Project (ECP) during 2021–2023. 

**When:** June 11-13, 2024, with multiple sessions each day.

**What:** CASS Community BOF Days provide an opportunity for the high-performance computing community to engage with scientific software teams to discuss their latest development efforts.  Each of the 2024 BOF sessions on a given topic will last from 60 to 90 minutes and include a brief overview and a Q&A. The BOFs will be conducted via Zoom.

**Interested in hosting a BOF session?**  We welcome BOF proposals from teams within the DOE lab community who produce and support widely used libraries and tools for advanced computing and/or are fostering software communities. 

**BOF proposal submission:** Complete this [**Google form**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1MnJS42q4b-d0Y2IONymO_UoO81aEazY6-muDpgVOj_k/edit)

**BOF proposal deadline: April 23, 2024**

**Notifications:** We plan to notify BOF submitters of their proposal’s status by early May. We will select among BOF proposals to create a balanced program overall. 

**BOF Guidance:** BOFs have a rich history throughout the high-performance computing community as highly regarded sessions of various formats (panels, presentations, round tables, etc.) developed to bring together individuals with shared interests.  BOF are designed to promote interactive community discussions of specific topics with the goal of fostering open, candid dialogue among the attendees.
