Scientific software is a critical component of the scientific discovery process. The development and use of scientific software is a complex and challenging endeavor that requires a diverse set of skills and expertise. The [PESO project](https://pesoproject.org) is a community-driven effort to promote the development and use of scientific software as an ecosystem with stakeholders and partners who engage with the US Department of Energy (DOE) in developing and using advanced high-performance computing.

Software ecosystems offer economies of scales in a variety of ways. They can provide a platform for sharing and reusing software components, tools, and libraries. They can also provide a platform for collaboration and coordination among software developers, users, and stakeholders. By promoting the development and use of scientific software as an ecosystem, PESO aims to create a sustainable and vibrant community of software developers, users, and stakeholders who work together to advance the state of the art in scientific computing.

The following links describes the promise of how investing in scientific software as an ecosystem can lead to a more productive and sustainable scientific discovery process for your organization:
