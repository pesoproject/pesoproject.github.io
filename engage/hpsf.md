[The High Performance Software Foundation (HPSF)](https://hpsf.io) is an open-source, vendor-neutral hub established to support high-performance software projects. It aims to advance a portable software stack for High-Performance Computing (HPC) by fostering increased adoption, lowering barriers to contribution, and providing resources to mature these projects. The initiative is designed to fill the growing needs of AI, accelerated computing, and cloud HPC by ensuring that HPC software remains fast, portable, and ready for production across diverse environments.  Some key attributes of HPSF are:

- **Neutral Governance:** HPSF provides a transparent, neutral governance model that allows stakeholders from government, industry, and academia to collaboratively steward the high-performance software ecosystem.

- **Resource Hub:** By serving as a central hub, HPSF offers projects the resources, connections, and infrastructure necessary to bring them to maturity and broaden their impact across multiple domains, including AI and scientific software.

- **Increased Adoption:** HPSF promotes the use of its member projects across various open-source communities and organizations, thereby increasing adoption and extending the reach of high-performance software.

- **Security and Reliability:** The foundation ensures that HPC software is both accessible and secure, collaborating with groups like CNCF and OpenSSF to support cloud readiness and secure supply chains.

- **Workforce Development:** Through sponsoring events and training programs, HPSF helps cultivate a diverse, skilled workforce capable of advancing the software in its ecosystem, ensuring long-term sustainability and growth.
