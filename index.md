## PESO: Toward a Post-ECP Software-Sustainability Organization

### PESO Overview
The PESO Project seeks to establish robust and sustainable scientific software capabilities aligned with the interests of the Department of Energy Office (DOE) of Advanced Scientific Computing Research (ASCR) via partnerships with software teams and communities within DOE, other US agencies, commercial scientific software developers, and the broader open source software community. In partnership with these teams and communities, we intend to engage with the scientific computing stakeholders, including DOE computing facilities, hardware and software vendors, other software organizations, US agencies, and industrial and international institutions.  The goal of these engagements is to advance scientific pursuits by providing advanced scientific libraries and tools to the user community in ways that optimize the cost and benefit sharing of DOE's investments in scientific libraries and tools.

### PESO Vision

The US DOE sponsors significant investments in reusable scientific libraries and tools that address the critical and emerging requirements for scientific applications that support the DOE mission.  PESO seeks to optimize the impact of DOE investments by engaging with developers, collaborators, users, and stakeholders of DOE-sponsored software efforts.  PESO will engage with software teams by providing resources that help them improve the quality of their work, and improve user access and experience. We will also facilitate the engagement of software teams with their stakeholders to better assure the alignment of requirements.  Through PESO infrastructure and activity investments, we will provide a curated portfolio of high-quality scientific libraries and tools.  This portfolio will enable accelerated scientific advances for applications that can depend upon the capabilities we provide.

### The "Hub-and-Spoke" Model

**PESO's Hub and Spoke Approach**

The Post-ECP Software-Ecosystem Sustainment (PESO) Project has adopted a "Hub and Spoke" approach to create a robust, coordinated, and sustainable scientific software-ecosystem. This strategy pivots on the interaction between Software Product Communities (SPCs) and Communities of Practice (COPs).

**Spokes**

   Known as SDKs or Software Product Communities (SPCs), spokes form an integral part of the PESO strategy. PESO aims to serve as a hub, forming aggregations with communities composed of compatible and interoperable products. It's anticipated that spokes will self-organize and establish their own community-specific governance that builds on, specializes, and adapts what PESO provides. 

   A spoke is expected to encompass both DOE-sponsored and commercial/community software, creating a cohesive ecosystem for a specific software domain. The value proposition for spokes includes shared design space exploration and coordination, which facilitates collaborative planning and unified progress.

**Hub Services**

PESO will play a role in maintaining and enhancing DOE open-source library and tools software ecosystem for advanced scientific computing. This role is facilitated through a range of key services:

- **Funding Coordination:** PESO proposes to create a process that enables software teams to propose work and budget that will be reviewed in collaboration with spoke leadership and stakeholders.  We will develop an objective set of criteria and a transparent process with a panel of community experts to make funding decisions.
- **Software Delivery and Deployment:** PESO will support the delivery and deployment of software through Spack and E4S to DOE Facilities and other key users. Efforts include comprehensive services such as Continuous Integration (CI) testing, issue triage, build caches, and quality assurance for software.
- **Stakeholder Engagement:** PESO will actively coordinate cross-cutting engagement with DOE Facilities, DOE sponsors, and other stakeholders, including other US agencies, industry partners, and international collaborators.
- **Software Lifecycle Support:** PESO will provide lightweight processes, models, and tools to support software product communities throughout their software lifecycle. This includes assistance with annual planning, execution, tracking, and assessment, all underpinned by comprehensive change management strategies. 

**Cross-cutting Hub Activities**

As part of its hub role, PESO also plans active engagement with leaders in cross-cutting activites. The PESO hub is a natural organization to support these activities. Examples of these communities include:
- **Community outreach:** Organizations like the Center for Scientific Collaboration and Community Engagement (CSCCE) help to expand the reach of the scientific software community, fostering greater collaboration and engagement.
- **Software foundations:** Groups like NumFOCUS and the Linux Foundation provide support for the development and sustainability of open-source software, enhancing the resilience and diversity of the ecosystem.
- **Workforce development:** Entities such as the IDEAS project, BSSw portal, and the HPC Best Practices webinars and initiatives such as US RSE, BSSw Fellows, and Sustainable Research Pathways help to build capacity and develop the skills needed for the sustainable management of scientific software.
- **Annual Community Meeting:** Community input indicates strong support for an annual meeting of all hub and spoke teams, representative stakeholders, and other community leaders who can contribute and learn from our efforts.
