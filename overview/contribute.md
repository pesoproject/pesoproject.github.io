## Contribute to PESO

Any member of the computational science and engineering community who has an interest in improving the leadership of scientific software teams is encouraged to submit content to PESO.  

While we welcome any relevant contribution to PESO,

**_We are particularly interested in contributions that address usability, sustainability and overall quality of leadership scientific software.  Contributions that describe gaps, requirements, areas for exploration or working approaches from other software communities are particularly welcome._**
