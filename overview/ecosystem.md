# Powers of 10

## **100,000+** Lines of code replaced with high-quality libs & tools
Using robust open-source libraries and tools helps you eliminate native source code that is less capable, more fragile, and harder to maintain.

## **10,000+** Community members via ecosystem collaborations
Shared experiences using the same ecosystem increases community knowledge base, improved software capabilities, and cross-teaming.

## **1,000+** Code teams share ecosystem costs & benefits
Pooling investments and making the software ecosystem available everywhere optimizes cost and benefit sharing across many users.

## **100+** Speedup using advanced devices like GPUs
ECP-sponsored applications realize a factor of 100 or more science-speedup by reformulating algorithms and software to exploit GPUs.

## **10+** Reduction in build times via Spack build caches
Spack build caches reduce re-build times by a factor of 10 or more, greatly reducing staff wait times and accelerating debugging and reconfiguration activities.

## **1** Source code base for all computing systems
Your single source code base that achieves performance portability, now and in the future, using libraries, tools, and compilers available via Spack and E4S.
