## Participate in PESO efforts

Any member of the computational science and engineering community who has an interest in improving the leadership of scientific software teams is encouraged to engage with PESO.  

While we welcome any relevant participation with PESO,

**_We are particularly interested in contributions that address usability, sustainability and overall quality of leadership scientific software.  Contributions that describe gaps, requirements, areas for exploration or working approaches from other software communities are particularly welcome._**
