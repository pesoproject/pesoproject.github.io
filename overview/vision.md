# PESO Vision

PESO will steward and advance a scientific software ecosystem with stakeholders and partners who engage with the US Department of Energy (DOE) in developing and using advanced high-performance computing.

**PESO's vision is that DOE software investments will have maximum impact by providing a sustainable scientific software ecosystem, consisting of high-quality libraries and tools that deliver the latest high-performance algorithms and capabilities to serve application needs at DOE and beyond.**

*Partnering* with others, PESO will provide critical *services* and *products* that **transform a broad collection of independently developed products by independent teams into a product portfolio whose total is much more than the sum of its parts.** Furthermore, by working with product teams, users, stakeholders, computing facilities, other US agencies, and industry, we will provide a transition of activities from the DOE Exascale Computing Project (ECP) toward the goal of creating a software ecosystem that year over year will deliver high-quality, reliable, and trusted libraries and tools for DOE's mission-critical applications.

ECP efforts have demonstrated that developing applications built on accelerator-optimized libraries and tools can improve scientific capabilities by two orders of magnitude or more and that a trusted software stack is an essential element. **PESO will provide the trusted software stack for applications to realize that 100X improvement---for high-end capabilities _and_ for energy efficiency improvements that can be realized only by leveraging accelerator devices.**
