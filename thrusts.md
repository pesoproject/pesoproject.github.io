Efforts in the PESO Project are organized into six thrust areas, each focusing on a specific aspect of scientific software development and deployment in the context of advanced high-performance computing (HPC). These thrusts are designed to address key challenges and opportunities in the field, with the goal of advancing the state of the art in scientific computing and enabling researchers to leverage the full potential of HPC resources. The following is a brief overview of each thrust area:

- **Thrust 1: Software Ecosystem Integration:** Focuses on integrating diverse software components into a cohesive ecosystem that supports advanced scientific computing, ensuring compatibility and optimized performance across various platforms.

- **Thrust 2: User-Developer Experience:** Aims to enhance the interaction between users and developers, improving the usability and efficiency of software tools while fostering a collaborative environment for ongoing development.

- **Thrust 3: Community Engagement:** Strengthens the involvement of the scientific community by fostering collaborations, disseminating best practices, and supporting open-source contributions to ensure the sustainability and evolution of the software ecosystem.

- **Thrust 4: Impact Frameworks:** Develops methodologies and tools to measure and maximize the impact of software on scientific research, ensuring that contributions lead to significant advancements and practical applications.

- **Thrust 5: E4S:** The Extreme-scale Scientific Software Stack (E4S) provides a curated collection of HPC software, ensuring easy access and deployment across different computing environments, with a focus on scalability and reproducibility.

- **Thrust 6: Spack:** A package manager designed to support the building and deployment of scientific software across diverse platforms, Spack is critical for managing complex dependencies and ensuring the portability and consistency of software installations across HPC environments.
